# Rust

Well done updating the training notebook to select new features
and re-train the model. Marimo chosen as the frontend for the
project, which provides a workable UI for users to interact with
the model. Good job getting a Docker pipeline up to package your
frontend into a container.

Good commit history shows a mostly balanced distribution of work
towards the project. Marimo prediction notebook demonstrates some
interactivity - you might consider further enhancing the training
notebook too. Nicely working Azure function app for the backend,
you could also build your API in FastAPI or another API library.
Good efforts at documenting the project in a README, consider
a more complete documentation solution such as mkdocs.
Well done getting your deployment running on Azure Container Apps
- this is a quick and reponsive app!
